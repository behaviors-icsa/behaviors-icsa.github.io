        <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
        <p>The Behaviors Workshop at ICSA 2026 unites HILA 2025 (Human-in-the-Loop Architectures) and SARECS 2025 (Adaptive and Embedded Systems) into one forum on the interplay between human and system behaviors in software architecture. Modern connected systems are increasingly behavior-centric, integrating human and dynamic system behaviors. Grounded in the Internet of Behaviors (IoB) paradigm, the workshop emphasizes architectures that link digital functionality to behavioral data for human-driven design, real-time adaptation, and behavior-resilient systems.<p></p>

<p> It explores human-in-the-loop architectures, where feedback, emotions, and interaction patterns influence system behavior in domains such as healthcare, smart cities, and IoT. It also focuses on self-adaptive, runtime-reconfigurable, and machine-learning-driven architectures, highlighting socio-technical feedback loops and co-adaptive systems where human and system behaviors shape one another. The goal is to advance behavior-driven architectures by integrating human and system perspectives and leveraging AI, machine learning, and digital twins. The workshop invites contributions on socio-technical interdependencies, interdisciplinary approaches, and real-world applications in smart healthcare, autonomous systems, and IoT/CPS ecosystems.</p>

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
          The workshop targets software architects and researchers interested in
          behavior‑aware computing. This includes professionals in software
          engineering, human‑computer interaction, artificial intelligence and
          machine learning, internet of things/cyber‑physical systems,
          distributed and embedded systems, and behavioral sciences who are
          exploring how behaviors impact architecture. The interdisciplinary
          scope encourages collaboration at the intersection of technical and
          human‑centric perspectives.

        <h2>Submission &amp; Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
          We will issue a call for papers inviting original research and
          experience reports. Submitted papers will undergo peer review to
          assess relevance, novelty and technical quality. Both full papers
          (up to 8 pages in IEEE CS format) and short position papers are
          solicited. Accepted papers will appear in the ICSA 2026
          Companion proceedings (IEEE Xplore) and must follow the IEEE CS
          proceedings format.

<p></p>
  All papers are to be submitted electronically via the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsa2026" style="color: #106E9D; text-decoration: underline;">EasyChair submission system</a> by the submission deadline and must not have been published before or be submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration at  Behaviors.    </p>
        <p>
          Each submission will be reviewed by three experienced reviewers who
          regularly serve on program committees in software architecture, HCI,
          AI and distributed systems. At least one author of each
          accepted paper must register and present at the workshop. A Best
          Paper Award will be presented to acknowledge outstanding
          contributions.
